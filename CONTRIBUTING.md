## Adding New Features

### New LLM Providers

To add a new provider:

1. Create `src/tacz/llms/providers/your_provider.py`
2. Implement required methods:
   ```python
   class YourProvider:
       def get_options(self, prompt: str, context: str) -> Optional[CommandsResponse]:
           # Implementation
           pass
   
       def is_available(self) -> bool:
           # Check if provider is accessible
           pass
   
       def get_provider_info(self) -> dict:
           # Return provider metadata
           pass
   ```
3. Update `provider_factory.py`
4. Add to constants and setup wizard
5. Add tests

### New Command Categories

To add a new command category:

1. Update `COMMAND_CATEGORIES` in `constants.py`
2. Add category-specific prompts in `templates.py`
3. Update the nano agent's categorization
4. Add tests for the new category
